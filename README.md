# Raise The Bar: Video-Based Barbell Path and Velocity Tracker

<p align="center">
Raise The Bar is a desktop tool for monitoring and displaying the range of motion and velocity statistics for a barbell during performance of the barbell Back squat. 
Statistics on average concentric velocity, peak velocity, displacement, and bar path are outputted during and after a set.
Uses AruCo tags and the OpenCV python library for optically tracking the barbell through a pre-recorded or webcam-streamed video.

# Motivation
Do you lift hard enough? 
The question of lifting intensity is a difficult one to measure. 
In general, lifting intensity is measured as a percentage of your 1-Repetition Max (1RM). 
Thus, if the most you can squat is 300 lbs, your 80% is 240 lbs. 
Yet, studies have shown wide daily fluctations in 1RM meaning this method is problematic.
As a team sport athlete, a competition over the weekend might negatively impact your performance on the following Monday.

Using velocity, we can objectively measure lifting intensity and performance preparedness week-to-week.
By setting velocity standards, we can auto-regulate the total weight lifted to better align with your preparedness.
